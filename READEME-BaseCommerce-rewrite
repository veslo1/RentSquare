Overview:
Need to rewrite all BC code to use new API using SDK.
1 - Prop mgr pays  ( 1 time set up and monnthly fee based on units )
2 - Tenant pays	   ( montly rents/fees )
3 - Split of Tenant pays so RSQ gets their piece

Tech Notes:
Setting up an 'interface' to abstract pay processor, although given unique way BC handles split on back end of rent pay so that RSQ gets its cut, a diff pay processor might require diff functionality.
Setting up in Vendors/Interfaces to keep App::import happy

 Interface components:
   	PayMethodInterface	- Interface class defining methods that must exist - no logic
        PayMethodUtils		- Class that implements interface
        PayMethodBaseCommerce	- The actual code called in PayMethodUtils for Base Commerce

	Places I found references to old API
		Controller/UsersController.php			- DONE - added vault add stuff
		Console/Command/MonthlyFeeShell.php		--> Calls Model Payment->processPayment
		Console/Command/UpdateBillingShell.php		
		Controller/PropertiesController.php		- added vault add stuff, need to test merch app submission
		Controller/PaymentMethodsController.php		- DONE - added vault add stuff
		Controller/PaymentsController.php		- processing payments - more testing
		Controller/AdminController.php			- wont need to change since activate property is not used anymore
		Vendor/Interfaces/PayMethods/PayMethodBasecommerce.php --> new code to handle all transactions


Property Manger pays:

- users/propertymanager
  - Payment data (checking/savings account) collected and sent to Vault
  -  Vault id set to 1 in db if add to vault fails
  - SubmitPPApplicaiton - this submits the merchant application, which gets sent to 3rd party for underwriting validation
	- if approved, email sent to Sean, with Code, which he then enters using admin funtion to approve within RentSquare

- Cron - MonthlyFeeShell.php calls Model method:  Payment->processPayment, using prop mgr vault info, to process the monthly payment for property managers

NOTE:  CAKE 2.6 has a runaway error situation when debug mode is on, so use logging and don't waste time chasing it down --- its a memory exhaustion situation that manifests

Tenant pays:

- paymentmethods/add_cc

- paymentmethods/add_bank

- paymentmethds/delete
   - calls Model delete_from_vault

LEFT OFF:
done - July 15 - Controllers/UsersController.php  -- Need to add code for submitting prop mgr data to BC

July 19 - TO DO - Controller/UsersController -- after vault add - write record to paymentmethods table 
                - add address info into ACH vault submission -- only needed for testing
		- PaymentMethods Model - get rid of add_...to vault  - check properties controller as it livs there too

ISSUES TO DISCUSS WITH SEAN & NICK

- Jul 15 - Cert tests for adding bank account requires address data, so I need to add to form
